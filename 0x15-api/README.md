## Project Overview

This project involves using Python to work with APIs and manage data. It includes tasks related to understanding APIs, REST, microservices, data formats, Python coding best practices, and practical implementation.

## Background Context

Old-school system administrators often rely on Bash scripting, but modern system administrators (SREs) are expected to have a broader skill set, including Python. This project focuses on accessing employee data via an API and organizing and exporting it using Python scripts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without the help of Google:

- What Bash scripting should not be used for
- What is an API
- What is a REST API
- What are microservices
- What is the CSV format
- What is the JSON format
- Pythonic naming conventions
- Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

## Requirements

Please review the following requirements for this project:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code should use Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Libraries imported in Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- Code should follow PEP8 Python style guidelines
- All your files must be executable
- All modules should have documentation
- Code should not be executed when imported
- Use `get` to access dictionary values by key
- Avoid plagiarism and respect copyright

## Documentation

Ensure that all your Python modules are well-documented. Use docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of your functions and classes. You can check this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)`.
