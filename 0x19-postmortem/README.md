# 0x19 Postmortem Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the postmortem for a web stack debugging project or outage. The goal is to analyze and document the incident, including its impact, root cause, timeline, and corrective measures.



## Concepts Covered

The project focuses on the concept of on-call and emphasizes the importance of postmortems in the tech industry.

## Task Overview

- **Impact:**
  - The [affected service] was [down/slow].
  - [Describe the user experience and the percentage of affected users].

- **Root Cause:**
  - [Provide a concise statement of the root cause of the issue].

#### Timeline

- **Issue Detected:**
  - [Date and Time, including timezone]

- **Detection Method:**
  - [Monitoring alert/an engineer noticed something/a customer complaint].

- **Actions Taken:**
  - [Specify the parts of the system investigated and the assumptions on the root cause].

- **Misleading Paths:**
  - [List any misleading investigation/debugging paths taken].

- **Escalation:**
  - [To which team/individuals was the incident escalated].

- **Resolution:**
  - [Describe how the incident was resolved].

#### Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:**
  - [Provide detailed information on what caused the issue].

- **Resolution:**
  - [Explain in detail how the issue was fixed].

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - [Broadly describe what can be improved or fixed].

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - [List specific tasks to address the issue, e.g., patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory].

## Manual QA Review

It is the responsibility of the author to request a review for the postmortem from a peer before the project’s deadline. If no peers have been reviewed, a review should be requested from a TA or staff member.

## Conclusion

This project is designed to enhance your understanding of on-call responsibilities and postmortem processes in the tech industry. Please adhere to the specified format and word count for a thorough and effective postmortem.

Incident Report: Application Downtime and Authentication Service Disruption
Issue Summary
Duration: September 10, 2023, 08:15 AM - September 10, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: Authentication service disruption resulted in a partial application downtime, affecting 20% of users. Users experienced login failures and inability to access secured features during the incident.
Timeline
Detection Time: September 10, 2023, 08:15 AM (UTC)
Detection Method: Automated monitoring systems triggered alerts for unusually high authentication error rates.
Actions Taken:
08:20 AM: Initial investigation by the Security Operations team identified a spike in failed login attempts.
08:30 AM: Assumed a potential security breach and escalated the incident to the Incident Response Team.
09:00 AM: Investigated misleading paths related to compromised user accounts but found no evidence of a breach.
09:30 AM: Incident escalated to the Authentication Services team for further analysis.
10:00 AM: Discovered that the root cause was a misconfiguration in the authentication server, causing service disruptions.
10:15 AM: Applied a rollback to the last known good configuration to restore authentication functionality.
11:30 AM: Service fully recovered, and users regained access to the application.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The service disruption was attributed to a misconfiguration in the authentication server, causing failed authentication attempts and subsequent denial of service.
Resolution:
Immediate resolution involved rolling back the authentication server to the last known good configuration. Long-term measures included implementing stricter configuration management practices for critical services.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance monitoring to detect misconfigurations in real-time and trigger alerts.
Implement stricter access controls to prevent unauthorized changes to critical services.
Conduct regular audits of authentication service configurations to identify and rectify potential issues.
Tasks:
Conduct a post-incident review to analyze the misconfiguration and improve detection mechanisms.
Implement automated testing for authentication service configurations to identify vulnerabilities.
Develop and implement a configuration change approval process to ensure proper oversight.
Provide training sessions for operations teams on identifying and resolving misconfigurations in critical services.
This incident highlights the importance of robust configuration management and proactive monitoring to ensure the seamless operation of authentication services. The corrective and preventative measures aim to strengthen the system against misconfigurations and unauthorized changes, safeguarding the application's authentication functionality.
